# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my repository for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**! This portfolio showcases my journey in bridging traditional economic theory with modern data science methods.

## About This Portfolio

I'm an undergraduate economics student passionate about applying rigorous quantitative methods to real-world economic questions. Through this coursework, I'm developing expertise in combining **causal inference** with **predictive analytics**—learning to not only forecast outcomes, but also understand the underlying mechanisms that drive economic phenomena.

This repository follows a **"Concept Extension"** approach: we begin with foundational statistical concepts (like ordinary least squares regression) and scale them up using modern Machine Learning algorithms (like Lasso, Ridge, and Random Forests). The goal is to understand when and why these tools matter, and how to apply them responsibly to economic data.

I'm actively seeking opportunities in **[Data Analysis / Economic Consulting / Finance]** where I can apply these skills to solve meaningful problems.
